        <span class="h1">Selling Policies and Seller Code of Conduct </span>
        <pre class="text-black">

All sellers are expected to adhere to the following policies when listing products on Kazary. Seller offences
and prohibited content can result in suspension of your Kazary account.
<br><span class="h4">Seller code of conduct</span><br>
This policy requires that sellers act fairly and honestly on Kazary to ensure a safe buying and selling
experience. All sellers must:
    * Provide accurate information to Kazary and our customers at all times
    * Act fairly and not misuse Kazary’s features or services
    * Not attempt to damage or abuse another Seller, their listings or ratings
    * Not attempt to influence customers’ ratings, feedback, and reviews
    * Not send unsolicited or inappropriate communications
    * Not contact customers except through Buyer-Seller Messaging
    * Not attempt to circumvent the Kazary sales process
    * Not operate more than one selling account on Kazary without a legitimate business need
Violating the Code of Conduct or any other Kazary policies may result in actions against your account, such as
cancellation of listings, suspension or forfeiture of payments, and removal of selling privileges. More details
about these policies are below. <br>
<br><span class="h4">Accurate Information</span><br>
You must provide accurate information to Kazary and our customers, and update the information if it changes.
For example, this means that you must use a business name that accurately identifies your business and list your
products in the correct category.
<br><span class="h4">Acting Fairly</span><br>
You must act fairly and lawfully and may not misuse any service provided by Kazary. Examples of unfair
activities include:
    * Providing misleading or inappropriate information to Kazary or our customers, such as by creating
    multiple detail pages for the same product or posting offensive product images
    * Manipulating sales rank (such as by accepting fake orders or orders that you have paid for) or making
    claims about sales rank in product titles or descriptions
    * Attempting to increase the price of a product after an order is confirmed
    * Artificially inflating web traffic (using bots or paying for clicks, for example)
    * Attempting to damage another Seller, their listings or ratings
    * Allowing other people to act on your behalf in a way that violates Kazary’s policies or your agreement
    with Kazary
<br><span class="h4">Ratings, Feedback, and Reviews</span><br>
You may not attempt to influence or inflate customers’ ratings, feedback, and reviews. You may request
feedback and reviews from your own customers in a neutral manner, but may not:
    * Pay for or offer an incentive (such as coupons or free products) in exchange for providing or removing
    feedback or reviews
    * Ask customers to write only positive reviews or ask them to remove or change a review
    * Solicit reviews only from customers who had a positive experience
    * Review your own products or a competitors’ products
    Communications
You may not send unsolicited or inappropriate messages. All communications to customers must be sent
through Buyer-Seller Messaging and be necessary for fulfilling the order or providing customer services.
Marketing communications are prohibited.
<br><span class="h4">Customer Information</span><br>
If you receive customer information such as addresses or phone numbers to fulfill orders, you may use that
information only to fulfill orders and must delete it after the order has been processed. You may not use
customer information to contact customers (except through Buyer-Seller Messaging) or share it with any third☻party.
<br><span class="h4">Circumventing the Sales Process</span><br>
You may not attempt to circumvent the Kazary sales process or divert Kazary customers to another website.
This means that you may not provide links or messages that prompt users to visit any external website or
complete a transaction elsewhere.
<br><span class="h4">Multiple Selling Accounts on Kazary</span><br>
You may only maintain one Seller Central account for each region in which you sell unless you have a
legitimate business need to open a second account and all of your accounts are in good standing. If any of your
accounts are not in good standing, we may deactivate all of your selling accounts until all accounts are in good
standing.
Examples of a legitimate business justification include:
    * You own multiple brands and maintain separate businesses for each
    * You manufacture products for two distinct and separate companies
    * You are recruited for an Kazary program that requires separate accounts
    <br><span class="h4">Filing Infringement Notices as an Agent or Brand Protection Agency</span><br>
Kazary understands that many brands may choose to have brand protection agencies or agents report
intellectual property infringement on their behalf and accepts submissions from authorized agents. However,
Kazary does not permit individuals with active selling accounts to file infringement notices as an agent of a
brand when the filing of those notices could benefit their own selling account (through removing competing
listings, for example). Any sellers filing notices as an agent to benefit their own status as a seller may have their
selling account terminated.
